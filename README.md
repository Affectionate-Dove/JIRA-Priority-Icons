# Why?
The default priority icons in JIRA are exactly the same arrors of slightly different colour. Even for a person without vision issues it can be difficult to tell which icon is which priority.

# What do we do now?

The goal of this work is to provide user-friendly icons for priorities of tickets in JIRA or any other system. The icons in this repository have been intentionally designed with accessibility in mind and provide more visual clues regarding their meaning:
* They all have different shape so that you can understand which priority they represent without relying on color.
* Their shape is based on repetition and orientation of ^ symbol and you can easily understand which is more important than the other.
* The color helps to distinguish low and high priority tickets.
